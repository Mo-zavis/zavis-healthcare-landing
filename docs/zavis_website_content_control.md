# ZAVIS Website — Content Control & Positioning File (for Claude Agent)

> Purpose: This file controls **what the website says**, not how it looks.  
> Layout and section order will be taken from the Hello Patient design-language file.  
> This file defines **ZAVIS voice, positioning, and section-by-section content intent**.

---

## GLOBAL INSTRUCTIONS (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)

1. Speak in **first person as ZAVIS** (“we”, “our platform”, “our teams support you”).  
2. Speak **directly to healthcare operators and leadership** (CMO, COO, Ops Head, Clinic Directors).  
3. Position ZAVIS as a **customer engagement platform for healthcare operations**, not a CRM and not only an AI caller.
4. Language must feel:
   - enterprise
   - operational
   - outcome‑driven
   - calm, not hype-driven
5. No references to any other companies or inspirations.
6. No filler or generic SaaS language.
7. If proof or numbers are not confirmed, phrase as **capability and intent**, not fabricated metrics.
8. Assume primary market: **UAE & GCC healthcare systems** (multi-site clinics, hospital groups, specialty networks).
9. Avoid Western‑only healthcare assumptions (insurance flows, referral flows may differ).
10. Every line must earn its place. No placeholder marketing fluff.

## CORE POSITIONING (USE EVERYWHERE)

### What ZAVIS is

ZAVIS is a healthcare customer engagement platform that coordinates conversations, workflows, and follow‑ups across voice, messaging, scheduling, intake, payments, and post‑visit engagement — with full visibility for care and operations teams.

We sit **on top of existing clinical and operational systems**, helping organizations respond faster, work smarter, and grow without adding headcount.

---

### What ZAVIS is NOT

- Not a CRM  
- Not just a chatbot  
- Not only an AI receptionist  
- Not a patient portal replacement  
- Not another disconnected communication tool

ZAVIS is the **operational engagement layer** between patients, staff, and systems.

## SECTION‑BY‑SECTION CONTENT BLUEPRINT

---

### HERO SECTION

**Goal:** Immediately define category + operational value.

#### Headline intent
Communicate:
- engagement
- operations
- outcomes

Examples of acceptable framing:
- “Turn every patient interaction into action.”
- “Coordinate care conversations and operations from one platform.”

Explain in one line what we actually do:

- integrated with systems

Example direction:
> We manage conversations across voice and messaging, automate scheduling and follow‑ups, and give your teams full visibility into what happens next.

#### CTA intent
Primary:
- Book a demo
Secondary:
- See how workflows run

No pricing CTA in hero for enterprise healthcare.

---

### WHO WE SERVE

**Goal:** Show market focus and relevance in GCC healthcare.

Segments should reflect:
1. Hospital and health system groups
2. Multi‑location specialty networks
3. High‑growth outpatient clinics

Each card must include:
- who it is for
- their operational pressure
- what ZAVIS unlocks

Example structure:
- For multi‑location specialty groups
- Managing appointment flow and patient follow‑ups across sites is complex
- We centralize engagement and automate routine coordination

Avoid niche or single‑doctor clinic framing.

---

### OUTCOMES SECTION

**Goal:** Operator ROI, not patient happiness marketing.

Themes:
- access
- efficiency
- utilization
- experience

Each tile:
- short outcome statement
- operational framing

Example categories:
- Faster access to care
- Lower operational workload
- Better schedule utilization
- More consistent follow‑through

Do not invent percentages unless validated.

---

### CORE SERVICES (CAPABILITIES)

**Goal:** Show coverage of the full patient journey.

Context line must always communicate:
> From first contact to post‑visit follow‑up, we coordinate the full engagement lifecycle.

Four capability pillars:

1. Engagement Inbox
   - unified conversations
   - routing and escalation
   - summaries for staff

2. Scheduling & Intake
   - booking flows
   - eligibility questions
   - forms and document collection

3. Payments & Reviews
   - payment links
   - deposits and reminders
   - post‑visit feedback

4. Outreach & Recall
   - reactivation
   - follow‑ups
   - population‑based campaigns

Each card must explain:
- what is automated
- what staff still control

---

### WORKFLOWS SHOWCASE

**Goal:** Demonstrate operational realism.

Introduce section with:
> Our workflows reflect how real clinics and hospitals operate — not idealized chatbot scripts.

Each workflow row must show:
- starting trigger
- automation steps
- human intervention points
- final resolution

Workflow examples:
- New patient inquiry to booked visit
- Missed call to resolved request
- Recall campaign to scheduled appointment

Avoid fictional patient stories. Focus on process.

---

### INTEGRATIONS SECTION

**Goal:** Remove fear of system replacement.

Context must communicate:
- ZAVIS does not replace core systems
- we connect to them

Messaging direction:
> We connect with your scheduling, clinical, and billing systems so teams don’t need to work in multiple tools.

Avoid naming vendors unless confirmed.

---

### SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

**Goal:** Enterprise reassurance.

Focus on:
- data protection
- access control
- operational reliability

Do not over‑promise certifications.

Frame as:
- designed for healthcare data environments
- supports regulatory compliance requirements in GCC where applicable

---

### PROOF SECTION

If real customers exist:
- use testimonials
- reference organization type, not just names

If early stage:
- frame as pilot partners
- focus on qualitative outcomes

Never fabricate logos or numbers.

---

### FINAL CTA

**Goal:** Reduce friction to engagement.

Include:
- short reassurance about onboarding
- one clear CTA

Example intent:
> Our team supports configuration and rollout so you can start seeing impact quickly.

CTA:
- Book a demo

---

## REGIONAL CONTEXT (UAE / GCC)

Language must reflect:

- multi‑site operations
- private healthcare networks
- high patient volume environments
- multilingual patient populations

Avoid:
- US‑centric insurance workflows
- referral gatekeeping assumptions

Prefer:
- access and throughput framing
- experience consistency across branches

---

## CONTENT QUALITY RULES

Before finalizing any section, check:

- Does this help an operator understand how ZAVIS helps their day?
- Does this reduce perceived risk of adoption?
- Does this align with enterprise healthcare buying logic?

If not, rewrite.

---

## HANDOFF TO DESIGN + DEV AGENT

When generating the site:

1. Use Hello Patient design system for:
   - layout rhythm
   - spacing
   - visual hierarchy

2. Use this file for:
   - copy intent
   - positioning logic
   - section messaging

3. Never mix visual reference language into final copy.

4. Final output must feel like:
   - modern healthcare platform
   - built for operations leadership
   - enterprise‑ready

---

## FINAL REMINDER

ZAVIS is not selling “AI”.  
ZAVIS is selling **operational leverage in healthcare engagement**.

Everything on the website must reinforce that.
